#### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look

the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. You may we

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

* If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note 
that this will _not_ affect your grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge your knowledge.
